    <h1>Random Odin Recipes</h1>
    <p>So, the assignment here was to make a simple website with some recipes using html... I have no idea what I'm doing. Here's two completely unrelated things. Lasagna was part of the assignment (optionally) and I just know rock candy doesn't have a lot of steps for me to have to copy and paste for the instructions part. Uhhh. Hello Odin Project, you are very fun to be going through <3 also I dont know how to do style sheets or css or js or anything yet BUT I WILL LEARN MWAHAHAHA
